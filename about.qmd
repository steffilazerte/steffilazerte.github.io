:::

Born and bred in Muskoka, Ontario I am a [consulting biologist and R programmer](R.html). I teach R, handle data management in R and develop R packages for a variety of disciplines in the Natural Sciences.

Beyond R, I'm a [behavioural ecologist](cv.html#education) with an interest in how humans influence behaviour of animals and how citizen science projects can be used to do great science and engage the public.

I enjoy [teaching](cv.html#teaching) and [outreach](cv.html#community-presentations-and-outreach) and try to spread the love of R and make science more accessible.

Outside of research, I love travelling, be it camping locally (with my kitties!) or flying to visit more distant destinations. But I also enjoy stay-at-home activities such as reading, gardening and spinning wool into yarn.

> I was honoured to receive the Society of Canadian Ornithologists/Société des ornithologistes du Canada's inaugural **[Early Career Research Award](https://www.sco-soc.ca/copy-of-speirs-award)** for 2017

### Beyond a place of work

I live in Brandon, Manitoba, a beautiful place with a long history, both natural and cultural that I 
wish to acknowledge and cherish.

I appreciate that territorial acknowledgements can be complex and can sometimes
be seen as insincere, a quick and easy way of appeasing [Truth and Reconciliation](https://nctr.ca/).

However, to me, an acknowledgement is a part of reconciliation. 
It isn't sufficient, but it's a first step. 
 
As such, I would like to acknowledge that I live and work in Treaty 2 
territory which is the traditional territory of the Dakota, Anishanabek, 
Oji-Cree, Cree, and Dene peoples as well as the homeland of the Métis Nation.
