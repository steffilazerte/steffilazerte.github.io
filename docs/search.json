I teach R, handle data management in R and develop R packages for a variety of disciplines in the Natural Sciences.\nBeyond R, I’m a behavioural ecologist with an interest in how humans influence behaviour of animals and how citizen science projects can be used to do great science and engage the public.\nI enjoy teaching and outreach and try to spread the love of R and make science more accessible.\nOutside of research, I love travelling, be it camping locally (with my kitties!) or flying to visit more distant destinations. But I also enjoy stay-at-home activities such as reading, gardening and spinning wool into yarn.\n\nI was honoured to receive the Society of Canadian Ornithologists/Société des ornithologistes du Canada’s inaugural Early Career Research Award for 2017\n\n\n\nBeyond a place of work\nI live in Brandon, Manitoba, a beautiful place with a long history, both natural and cultural that I wish to acknowledge and cherish.\nI appreciate that territorial acknowledgements can be complex and can sometimes be seen as insincere, a quick and easy way of appeasing Truth and Reconciliation.\nHowever, to me, an acknowledgement is a part of reconciliation. It isn’t sufficient, but it’s a first step.\nAs such, I would like to acknowledge that I live and work in Treaty 2 territory which is the traditional territory of the Dakota, Anishanabek, Oji-Cree, Cree, and Dene peoples as well as the homeland of the Métis Nation."

However, the learning curve is fairly steep to start out. I aim to help reduce this learning curve by explaining R in ways that make sense to non-programmers. I also help explain workflows and general best-practices. There is so much more to R than simply statistics.\nI teach through formal classes/lectures, workshops, group tutoring, and informal one-on-one tutoring, remote or locally.\n\n\nData management\nI specialize in managing, preparing and analyzing large and complex data sets used in the fields of environmental monitoring, conservation, ecology, behaviour, evolution, and other natural sciences.\nAs a biologist specializing in behavioural ecology I also have the training to consider experimental and statistical protocols, biological relevance and other necessary considerations when preparing data for analysis.\n\nCreated with Quarto by Steffi LaZerte; Updated 2023-08-23\nTwitter|Mastodon|Email"

However, even better is to use na.exclude.\n\nm <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_depth_mm, data = penguins, na.action = na.exclude)\n\nThis also excludes missing values (NA’s) from the analysis, but not from the data you extract from the model (which makes it much easier to combine back with your raw data set when performing Diagnostics).\nSession Info\n\ndevtools::session_info()\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21)\n os       Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS\n system   x86_64, linux-gnu\n ui       X11\n language en_CA:en\n collate  en_CA.UTF-8\n ctype    en_CA.UTF-8\n tz       America/Winnipeg\n date     2023-06-06\n pandoc   2.19.2 @ /usr/lib/rstudio/resources/app/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package        * version date (UTC) lib source\n cachem           1.0.8   2023-05-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n callr            3.7.3   2022-11-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n cli              3.6.1   2023-03-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n crayon           1.5.2   2022-09-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n devtools         2.4.5   2022-10-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n digest           0.6.31  2022-12-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n ellipsis         0.3.2   2021-04-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n evaluate         0.20    2023-01-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n fansi            1.0.4   2023-01-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n fastmap          1.1.1   2023-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n fs               1.6.2   2023-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n glue             1.6.2   2022-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n htmltools        0.5.5   2023-03-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n htmlwidgets      1.6.2   2023-03-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n httpuv           1.6.9   2023-02-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n jsonlite         1.8.4   2022-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n knitr            1.42    2023-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n later            1.3.0   2021-08-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n lifecycle        1.0.3   2022-10-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n magrittr         2.0.3   2022-03-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n memoise          2.0.1   2021-11-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n mime             0.12    2021-09-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n miniUI           0.1.1.1 2018-05-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n palmerpenguins * 0.1.1   2022-08-15 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n pillar           1.9.0   2023-03-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n pkgbuild         1.4.0   2022-11-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n pkgconfig        2.0.3   2019-09-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n pkgload          1.3.2   2022-11-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n prettyunits      1.1.1   2020-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n processx         3.8.1   2023-04-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n profvis          0.3.7   2020-11-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n promises         1.2.0.1 2021-02-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n ps               1.7.5   2023-04-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n purrr            1.0.1   2023-01-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n R6               2.5.1   2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n Rcpp             1.0.10  2023-01-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n remotes          2.4.2   2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n rlang            1.1.1   2023-04-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n rmarkdown        2.21    2023-03-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n rstudioapi       0.14    2022-08-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n sessioninfo      1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n shiny            1.7.4   2022-12-15 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n stringi          1.7.12  2023-01-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n stringr          1.5.0   2022-12-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n tibble           3.2.1   2023-03-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n urlchecker       1.0.1   2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n usethis          2.1.6   2022-05-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n utf8             1.2.3   2023-01-31 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n vctrs            0.6.2   2023-04-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n xfun             0.39    2023-04-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n xtable           1.8-4   2019-04-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n yaml             2.3.7   2023-01-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n\n [1] /home/steffi/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.3\n [2] /usr/local/lib/R/site-library\n [3] /usr/lib/R/site-library\n [4] /usr/lib/R/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"

    "text": "DHARMa is a great R package for checking model diagnostics, especially for models that are typically hard to evaluate (e.g., glms etc.).\nSimulated Residuals\nDHARMa works by simulating residuals.\nThis figure (from the DHARMa tutorial) is an illustration of how the residuals are calculated…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your data perfectly matched your model, what would the values look like?\n\nPink histogram values show repeatedly simulated values expected\n\n\nHow do your actual values compare?\n\nBlack arrow on x-axis shows actual value\nBlack arrow on y-axis shows residual calculated\nResiduals calculated by where observation lies on cumulative density of simulated values\n\n\nResiduals are scaled (0 to 1)\n\nIf data fits model perfectly, expect all residuals ~ 0.5\nTherefore, a good fit is always = flat/uniform distribution\n\n\nInterpreting Residuals\nIf your data fits the model\n\nResiduals follow a flat (uniform) distribution (no matter what model!)\n\nExpect: Straight line on QQ plot of uniform distribution (similar to QQ Normal plot)\n\nExpect: No patterns between residuals and model predictions (similar to heteroscedasticity plot, resid vs. fitted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nThese aren’t the same residual plots that one would usually use to assess model fit, but you can interpret them in a similar manner, when looking for problems\n\nCloser Look at QQ Plots\n\nVisual check of uniform distribution (expect points to match line)\nTests Uniformity with Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test (Uniform distribution)\nTests for Over/Underdispersion with Dispersion Test\nTests for more Outliers than expected with Outlier test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloser Look at Residuals vs. Predicted Plots\n\nCheck distribution of residuals (visually and with quantile tests)\n\nDotted lines show expected quantiles\nBlack lines show simulated quantiles (want straight lines)\n\nOutliers would show up as red stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlibrary(DHARMa)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nm <- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins)\nr <- simulateResiduals(m, n = 1000, plot = TRUE)\n\n\n\nsimulateResiduals() function from\nUse plot = TRUE to produce diagnostic plots to see if simulated match expectation\n\nn = 1000 isn’t strictly necessary but runs more simulations to produce more stable results\nApplicable to Most Linear Models\n\nREMEMBER! Not assessing residuals in the traditional way…\nAssessing whether residuals fit expected pattern given this model\nThis includes assumptions, but also includes general fit, etc.\nSo, we can use this to see if our model could be improved…\nAnd we can use DHARMa to test various different types of models\n\nFor example, binomial models\n\npenguins <- mutate(penguins, \n                   size = flipper_length_mm > median(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nm <- glm(size ~ species, family = \"binomial\", data = penguins)\nr <- simulateResiduals(m, plot = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Tests\nIn addition to testing for outliers, over/underdispersion, etc., DHARMa also has tests for zero-inflation.\nBut important to remember that…\n\nzero-inflation may also appear as iffy residuals\noverdispersion can lead to false positives (so address overdispersion first)\n\n\ntestZeroInflation(m)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    DHARMa zero-inflation test via comparison to expected zeros

Understanding whether you’ve satisfied these assumptions and checking for potential problems are some of the hardest things to do in statistics.\nFor simple linear models (lm()) the main assumptions are\n\n\nLinear relationship between response (y) and predictors (x’s).\n\nIndependence - Observations are independent\n\nno hierarchical sampling, no nested designs, no variables are calculated from each other\n\n\n\nNormality - Residuals are normally distributed\n\nConstant variance - There is constant variance in residuals (no heteroscedasticity)\n\n\nNote that it’s the normality of residuals and NOT the raw data that matters\n\nAnd the main cautions are\n\n\nMulticollinearity - You don’t want high levels of multicollinearity\n\nWhen predictors are highly correlated they can to influence the parameters calculated\n\n\n\nInfluence - You don’t want one or two points have an undue influence on your model\n\nOtherwise you should think about how relevant (and generalizable) that model really is\n\n\n\nDiagnostics in R\nSome assumptions/cautions are those of design (i.e. Independence), and some are assessed by evaluating your model fit in R. Some, like the expectation of a Linear Relationship, can be assessed in different ways, by plotting your relationship, or by looking at your residuals (as if there’s a problem, you’ll see problems in the Normality and Variance of your residuals).\nIn R, we can extract the residuals (residuals()) and fitted (fitted()) values to assess Normality and Constant variance. We can also use functions like vif() and cooks.distance() to calculate metrics which will help us assess Multicollinearity and Influential observations.\nLet’s extract and calculate the observation-level values we’ll need for these assessments.\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins) # For penguins data set\nlibrary(dplyr)          # For data manipulation\n\n# We'll only use Adelie penguins for now\np <- filter(penguins, species == \"Adelie\") \n\n# Run model\nm <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_depth_mm, data = p, na.action = na.exclude)\n\n# Extract residuals and fitted values\np <- mutate(p, \n            resid = residuals(m),      # Residuals\n            fitted = fitted(m),        # Fitted values\n            cooks = cooks.distance(m), # Cook's distance\n            obs = 1:n())               # Observation ids\n\nAssessing Assumptions\nWe use residuals to look at this fit.\nWhat are residuals?\nFor a simple linear model, residuals are essentially the error between your observations and your model. Fitted values are the predicted value of your response given the model and your explanatory values.\nFor example, in this linear model looking at the relationship between body_mass_g and bill_depth_mm in Adelie penguins, we can picture the residuals as the degree of difference between the model line and our data points.\n\nCodelibrary(patchwork)      # To combine plots\nlibrary(ggplot2)        # For plotting\nlibrary(tidyr)          # For data manipulation\n\n# Model plot\ng1 <- ggplot(data = p, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, colour = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(size = 2)\n\n# Add residuals\ng2 <- g1 +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = bill_depth_mm, yend = fitted, colour = resid), size = 1) +\n  scale_colour_viridis_c()\n\ng1 + g2\n\n\n\n\nNormality\nWe want our residuals from our model to be normally distributed. We can use a histogram or a QQ plot to assess this based on the residuals we extract from the model.\n\n# Histogram\ng1 <- ggplot(data = p, aes(x = resid)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n# QQ Plot\ng2 <- ggplot(data = p, aes(sample = resid)) +\n  stat_qq() +\n  stat_qq_line()\n\ng1 + g2\n\n\n\n\nLooks good!\nConstant variance\nWe want the variability in our model residuals to be relatively constant (or at least to not show any definied patterns). It shouldn’t increase or decrease with the fitted values, and should be relatively scattered throughout. We can plot the residuals by fitted values to make sure we don’t see any patterns.\nWe’re checking for heteroscedasticity\n\nggplot(data = p, aes(x = fitted, y = resid)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks good!\nCheck for problems\nMulticollinearity\nMulticollinearity assess whether your explanatory variables are overly correlated. This means it only applies if you have a multiple regression (i.e.. where you have more than one explanatory variable).\nLet’s consider this model\n\nm2 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm, data = p, na.action = na.exclude)\n\nLook at our two explanatory variables\n\nggplot(data = p, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\nThey are definitely correlated, but that doesn’t mean we have a problem. We need to investigate if it interferes with the model.\nThere are several ways to assess multicollinearity. Here we’ll use vif()1 function from car package.\n\nlibrary(car)\nvif(m2)\n\n    bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm \n         1.104521          1.104521 \n\n\nAlthough with all statistical measures, there is no magic number, generally a VIF > 10 is considered a problem, and VIF > 5 is concerning.\nSo in this case we can assume that while there is a correlation, it’s not haveing an undue effect on how we interpret the model.\nInfluence\nYou’ll want to check if your model results are highly influenced by any specific observations. For example, if you remove one observation and the entire model changes, you’ll have to think about how generalizable that model really is.\nOne way of checking whether any observations have an unusually high influence on your model is to look at the Cook’s distance (D).\nThere are several ways of considering what D is too high. One is that D below 1 is good, the other is that you should aim for a D below 4 / no. observations.\n\ng <- ggplot(p, aes(x = obs, y = cooks)) +\n  geom_point()\n\ng + geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = \"dotted\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng + geom_hline(yintercept = 4/nrow(p), \n                linetype = \"dashed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, having a high D doesn’t mean you automatically remove the observation, it means you think about what influence that observation is having on your model. Try omitting it and see how your model changes!\nSession Info\n\ndevtools::session_info()\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version

Create the files\nThis step is where you create (by hand or with software), the actual html files which are the website. You can create these files and not put them on the Internet. Which means you have a website on your computer (local), which only you can see. This is great for previewing your website before putting it or any changes onto the Internet.\n\n\n2. Serve the files\nThis is when you put (serve or host) your html files on the Internet. You need a server to serve or host the files and generally1 you go through an external company to do this for you (i.e. a Hosting service, or GitHub).\n\n\n3. Link a domain name\nThis step is often optional, depending how you are serving your website. If you use GitHub to serve your website, you will have a website address of https://yourgithubusername.github.io. If you want to buy (or really, rent) a domain name and point it to the website, then you can have a website address of something like https://your-domain-name.com (mine is https://steffilazerte.ca).\n\n\nQuarto and GitHub\nSo if you want to make a website with Quarto and GitHub you will be creating the website files with Quarto (step 1) and serving the files with GitHub (step 2). You can optionally also decide to buy a domain name and link it to your website (step 3)."

This may not be a terribly sensible example (and note that we’re skipping the all important step of checking our model!), but it should hopefully illustrate these tools.\nFirst let’s create a linear model.\n\nm <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length_mm * bill_depth_mm, data = penguins)\n\nWe can explore the results by looking at the summary() table\n\nsummary(m)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length_mm * bill_depth_mm, \n    data = penguins)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-10.6952  -2.5439  -0.2036   2.4788  19.9132 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                Estimate Std.

In this case, we can interpret the interaction as: for every 1 mm increase in flipper length, the effect of a 1 mm increase on bill depth increases by 0.029.\nHmm, not incredibly intuitive!\nThe marginalmeans package can be used to explore models with interactions via “conditional marginal effects” and predictions\nConditional marginal effects\nThese are really nice way of visualizing the verbal interpretation we made above.\nWe’ll use the plot_slopes() function to plot the effect of one variable on the slope of the other (i.e. an interaction!).\nHere, we look at the effect of bill depth on the slope of flipper length (i.e. the effect of flipper length on our response, bill length).\nThe Y-axis represents the slope of the effect of flipper length on bill depth.\n\nplot_slopes(m, variables = \"flipper_length_mm\", condition = \"bill_depth_mm\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Slope of flipper length\")\n\n\n\n\nThis figure is a visualization of our interaction parameter, but also puts things into the proper context and includes confidence intervals!\nHere we see that a) the slope is always positive, b) becomes stronger for increasing bill depth.\nPlotting predictions\nWe can plot the predictions to get a visual of this interaction.\n\nplot_predictions(m, condition = list(\"flipper_length_mm\", \"bill_depth_mm\"),\n                 point = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see the various lines (slopes) representing the effect of flipper length on bill length across different bill depths. We see that the effect (slope) increases as bill depth increases (compare the line with bill depth at 21.5 to the one with bill depth at 13.1). This is another visual representation of what we stated above, with additional context. In addition to seeing that all the slopes are positive, and the changes make them stronger, we see this in relation to the original data.\nI find this kind of plot useful for sharing your results as it shows the raw data along with the model results and a clear explanation of what that interaction really means.\nConclusions\nInterpreting interactions can be much simpler with visual aids, and it’s a good idea to use these figures not only for your benefit but for the benefit of anyone you’re sharing your work with.\nYou can make these figures by hand, but using marginalmeans will make it much easier (if slightly less customizable).\nFurther

If you have a citation you think I should include or think there’s something I’m missing, please open an issue in the GitHub repository and let me know (ideally with a citation!)\n\nThis is a living collection and things might change!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking a Website with GitHub/Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub\n\n\nwebsite\n\n\nprofiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 23, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting interactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstats\n\n\nmodels\n\n\ninteractions\n\n\npredictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 6, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nDHARMa - Diagnostics for General Linear Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstats\n\n\nlm\n\n\ndiagnostics\n\n\nglm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagnostics for Simple Linear Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstats\n\n\nlm\n\n\nvif\n\n\nnormality\n\n\ndiagnostics\n\n\nresiduals\n\n\ncooks-d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 15, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Basic Linear Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstats\n\n\nlm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical Workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstats\n\n\nlm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
