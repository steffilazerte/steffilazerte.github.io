Hi! I'm Steffi LaZerte, an independent biological consultant and R programmer, and part time Community Assistant at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/about/#team).

I provide services in **R Package Development**, **R Workflows** (including data management and analysis), and **R Workshops**. If you are interested in any of these services, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:sel@steffilazerte.ca).

## Services


### R Package Development
I am the author of [several R packages](R.html) providing a variety of services from accessing historical weather data from Environment and Climate Change Canada's website ([`weathercan`](https://github.com/ropensci/weathercan)) to accessing NatureCounts animal observations ([`naturecounts`](https://github.com/birdscanada/naturecounts)).

I also help update existing packages, from minor (e.g., [rcaaqs](https://github.com/bcgov/rcaaqs)) to major (e.g., [motus](https://github.com/motusWTS/motus), [bbsBayes2](https://github.com/bbsbayes/bbsbayes2), [ARUtools](https://github.com/ARUtools/ARUtools)) changes.

I take pride in developing R packages that are not only powerful but user-friendly, including informative errors, in-depth tutorials, and instructions. I also prioritize error checking and testing to ensure packages are robust. 

### R Workflows
I specialize in preparing data workflows for complex data sets used in the fields of environmental monitoring, conservation, ecology, behaviour, evolution, and other natural sciences (e.g., [Aquifer Factsheets](https://github.com/bcgov/aquifer-factsheets)). I combine these workflows with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) reports and websites as needed to ensure an open and reproducible record (e.g., [Weather and Mosquitoes](https://github.com/steffilazerte/mosquitoes_weather), [Vulture Migration](https://steffilazerte.ca/vulture_migration/), [Urban Stopovers and Motus tracks](https://steffilazerte.ca/urban_motus).

As a biologist specializing in behavioural ecology I also have the training to consider experimental and statistical protocols, biological relevance and other necessary considerations when preparing data for analysis.


### R Workshops
The power of R to manage and visualize data, to create reports, and perform reproducible statistics is immense. However, the learning curve is fairly steep to start out. I aim to help reduce this learning curve by explaining R in ways that make sense to non-programmers. I also help explain workflows and general best-practices. There is so much more to R than simply statistics.
I run workshops on [Dealing with Data in R](https://github.com/steffilazerte/workshop-dealing-with-data), [Introduction to Rmarkdown/Quarto for Reproducibility](https://github.com/steffilazerte/intro_to_rmarkdown), and an introductory workshop to [Figures in R](https://github.com/steffilazerte/Figures-in-R).
