A list of cool R packages & resources, updated when I think about it

## Visualizations
Packages useful for visualizing data

- [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) - Joining figures together

## Data 
For working with data or specific data types

#### Packages

- [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) - General collection of packages for managing, summarizing, transforming data
- [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) - Dealing with dates and datetimes
- [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) - Pattern match strings (text)
  - Amazing [article](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html) on how to use regex 
- [assertr](https://docs.ropensci.org/assertr/) - Test that your data is as it should be

#### Resources

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) [book] by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund
- [R4DS Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) - Community for learning R, generally with the tidyverse, originally developed as an "R for Data Science" (R4DS) book club

## Spatial Data

#### Packages

## Workflows
Packages useful for workflows

- [pak](https://pak.r-lib.org) - For installing packages from any locations
  - I find pak more informative, quicker, and just simpler than `install.packages()`
  - e.g., `pak::pkg_install("packageName")`
- [quarto](https://quarto.org/) - A package but also a standalone program for creating reports from your R scripts
- [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) - Creates pretty tables for reports

## Package Development[^1]

[^1]: Making packages

#### Packages

- [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) - Automates a lot of setup to make things quicker
  - e.g., `usethis::use_testthat()` to quickly set up testthat infrastructure
- [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) - Create package documentation website from your docs and vignettes
- [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) - Tests for your package

#### Resources
