This is a collection statistical notes, general tips and tricks, and useful citations which 
serve as a reference I can use when helping others with R, especially for statistics in the natural sciences.

I sometimes include some statistical guidance, but generally speaking I assume
some background in statistics. 
**Generally, these notes cover more of the *how*, not the *why* of statistics**.

Everywhere possible I cite my information be it a stackoverflow question or an
academic journal article. 
If you have a citation you think I should include or think there's something I'm missing, 
please open an issue in the GitHub repository and let me know (ideally with a citation!)

> **This is a living collection** and things might change!
